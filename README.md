# My Personal Project
## **Project Proposal**
My project, *Inventory A*, is a desktop software that functions as an inventory for shirts and trousers in a clothing store. It takes a list of incoming clothing items and classifies them based on the clothing type and size.  The application will also have a feature to keep track of the purchasing trends of certain items by recording the number of sales for each item. This application will be used by the business to keep track of what clothes are available, and by the popularity of the item, what items they need to restock. This application will also have a feature to request for certain items a customer is interested in. This project interests me as it could apply to a professional setting; in particular, aiding the organization of items in a clothing business to keep track of trends and handle requests from customers.
